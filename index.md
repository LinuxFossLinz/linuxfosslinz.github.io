The Linux / FOSS Group Linz is a community of Linux and Open Source fans, centered around Linz (Upper Austria).
It was founded by 3 ambitious teenagers in October of 2023 with the intention of organising regular meetups and get-togethers.

## Call for Hosts
Without a location, not even a get-together without sessions would be a thing.
