On the 18th of January 2024, we held our very first meetup.
It went overwhelmingly well, over 30 people learned, laughed and chatted with each other.

<br>
A huge thanks to the awesome Robert Führicht and Daniel Knittl-Frank for presenting!
Additionally, we want to express our deep gratitude to Rainer Stropek who helped us immensely throughout the planning process.
Without people like them (and everyone who helped in one way or another!), this wouldn't have been the staggering success it was.

<br>
Oh, also, our school [published an article](https://www.htl-leonding.at/2024/01/22/htl-schueler-organisieren-linux-foss-meetup-in-linz/) about the event :)
