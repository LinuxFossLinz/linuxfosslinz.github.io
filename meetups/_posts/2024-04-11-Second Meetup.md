On the 11th of April 2024, it was finally time for our second meetup, and it was amazing!


<br>
A huge thank you to all the people that attended the meetup and listened to the amazing talks from Michael Schöndorfer and Alireza Sadraii Rad. A lot of interesting topics were discussed, and we had a lot of fun with the amazing linux community and tasty snacks that were provided by Hello again :)! Lastly, a big "thank you" for the amazing Talks to Michael Schöndorfer and Alireza Sadraii Rad.

We are hoping that we see a lot of familiar faces soon at the next Meetup!
